Testing
-------

There is a module called mod_http_test.

I symlinked the rfc4627_jsonrpc to the root of this directory, hence the
ERL_LIBs path.

This is how I am booting it ATM:

$ make distclean package package_tests && ERL_LIBS=deps:dist:. erl -boot start_sasl -s crypto -s mod_http

For some reason, you need to start rfc4627_jsonrpc programmically ATM,
mod_http_test depends on this:

1> application:start(rfc4627_jsonrpc).
ok
2> application:start(mod_http_test).
ok

And then go to http://localhost:8000/ in a browser.
